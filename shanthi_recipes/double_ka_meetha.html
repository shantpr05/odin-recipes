    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices of White Bread</li>
        <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup Water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cardamom powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Raisins</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Cashews</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Almonds, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Pistachios, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the bread slices into quarters or halves and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a deep pan and fry the bread pieces until they are golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, lightly fry the cashews, almonds, pistachios, and raisins until golden. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, combine the sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Bring to a boil and let it simmer until slightly thickened. Add cardamom powder and stir well.</li>
        <li>In another pot, heat the milk and condensed milk together. Bring to a gentle boil and then lower the heat.</li>
        <li>Place the fried bread pieces in the pan with the sugar syrup and let them soak for a few minutes, ensuring they absorb the syrup.</li>
        <li>Pour the warm milk mixture over the soaked bread pieces and cook on low heat until the bread softens and absorbs most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the fried nuts and raisins.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or chilled as desired.</li>
    </ol>
